1. Introduction

Medication non-adherence is a common problem affecting many patients, especially those managing chronic conditions or multiple prescriptions. People often forget to take their medicine on time or take the wrong dosage. Mobile applications provide a practical way to support users through reminders and simple tracking.

This project focuses on designing a medication reminder mobile application that helps users remember when and which medicine to take.

2. Problem Statement

Many patients miss medication doses due to forgetfulness, busy schedules, or poor organization. Some existing reminder solutions are too complex or require constant internet access, making them unsuitable for all users. There is a need for a simple, reliable, and offline-capable medication reminder application.
